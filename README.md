# Reducing Single Point of Failure using Service Workers
If you are building a website today thereâ€™s a good chance that you rely on 3rd party libraries to provide you with extra functionality. Tracking scripts, A/B testing and adverts are just a few of the many reasons why you would want to use a 3rd party library. The problem is that if the library that you use is hosted on another server, you risk creating a single point of failure (SPOF). If for any reason the server that is hosting these libraries goes down, or is slow to respond, your site will unfortunately be affected by this.

This repo contains the working code for an article on 2015's Performance Calendar. It discusses how you can reduce SPOF using the power of Service Workers in your website.
